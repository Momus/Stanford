* Introduction
 
** 01 Intro to Class

*** How networks are designed and how they work is the moral
- Everything we see will be on line with us every day.
- If we are good we get a certificate.  But NO STFRRD CREDIT!!!!!


** 02 Why you should care about the Internet - Why this course?

*** Most important invention... arguably.

+ Second (or third) Industrial Revolution
+ 1/4 of CS jobs have to do with computer networks

*** This Course:

- How networks work: principles, design, and implemination
- Use principles to understand Internet, apply to build better 'net in future
- Forces that Shape The Inrawebs.

** Networks are arranged in layers
- Each layer of the network provides a well defined service to the
  layer above.
- Break down the process of communication into a useful set of
  services that can easily be re-used by other applications. e.g:
  + Application: e.g., web client et.c ; calls through an interface:
  + Transport Layer
    - Ensures that the bites that the Application wants to deliver to
      the network correctly
    - Any ones missing are re-transmitted
    - And they are delivered

** Example HTTP: Web Server 
- Application :: GET file
- Transport :: TCP takes "GET FILE" command, sends them to other end
- Network :: IP: the "thin waist of the Internet.  Assembles the bites
            into data-grams.  These are the bytes sent down form the
             transform layer. Adds IP address to hop
- Link :: Ethernet: sends frames containing Ethernet address into
          network
** Peer Layers Communicate
   :Application: ---- GET file et c.
   :Transport: to peer et c.
   :Link: physical links between machines.

** Encapsulation
- Data encapsulated in TCP header, encapsulated in IP data-gram, in an
  Ethernet header, the Ethernet
- The Ethernet address is the link: the next hop.  The IP address will
  be that of the eventual destination, which is looked up hop by hop to
  get sent on its way.

** Network could be more complex:

-Ethernet switches: look only at Ethernet address.  IP essentially invisible.

** Recap
   :Application: Talks to its peer, sends commands to its peer. 
   :Transport: Makes sure bytes get sent correctly in sequence, and it will re-transmit anything  that will get lost along the way.
   :Network: Encapsulates Transport data into IP datagrams and sends it along the network path
   :Link: Packets go link-by-link encapsulated by Ethernet frames
   
** Where do these layers run?
   :Application: As a user process in user space. The Socket API used by the application process to call upon the network stack that is running inside the OS
   :Transport: Operates inside the operating system.
   :Network: Called "Layer 3" 'cause of the seven layer model.
